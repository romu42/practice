Loop through the lines, for each line:

strip off any leading spaces,
check if the first character is lowercase,

strip the trailing dot (.) and exclamation mark (!) from this last word,

Return the results list.

One really nice feature of Python is polymorphism: using the same operation
on different types of objects.
Let's talk about an elegant feature: slicing.
You can use this on a string as well as a list for example
'pybites'[0:2] gives 'py'.
 The first value is inclusive and the last one is exclusive so
here we grab indexes 0 and 1, the letter p and y.
  When you have a 0 index you can leave it out so can write this as 'pybites'[:2]
but here is the kicker: you can use this on a list too!
['pybites', 'teaches', 'you', 'Python'][-2:] would gives ['you', 'Python']
and now you know about slicing from the end as well :)
keep enjoying our bites!
